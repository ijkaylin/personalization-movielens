Personalization Theory: Recommending Top 5 Movies for MovieLens users

This is the repository for the code and notebook for Part1 and Part 2 of the project. We used the movielens dataset with 10m ratings. These can be found in ratings.dat.

Before doing anything, you must download the dataset Dataset here, and place the files ratings.dat, movies.dat, and tags.dat in the Part2/ directory. They are not included in this repository because they're very large files.

The notebook file contains a write up and explanation of our methods. We sampled subsets of the data by taking the most popular users and items and training a KNN model and matrix factorization model on the subsets.

All of the functional code is in the file called funcs.py. script.py reads in the data, and trains and tests the model on a number of different sample sizes and hyper parameter (k in knn, latent factors in svd), and gives summary results about runtime, RMSEs, MAEs, and some other data, and writes it to a JSON file.

If you'd like to try running the model with arbitrary parameters, simply open the file and edit the samples array and hyperparameter options as you like. Run python script.py inside the Part1 directory; the summary data will be written to Part1/output.json. Keep in mind that some of the training may take a very long time (hours), depending on your sample size. This is the offline phase of our model.

We use some of the data from these offline runs in the notebook.
